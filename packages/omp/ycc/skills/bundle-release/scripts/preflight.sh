# Pre-flight gate for the bundle-release skill.
# Checks that the git working tree is clean, every product version field is in
# parity with ycc/.claude-plugin/plugin.json (all marketplace plugins[] entries
# and package manifests; ycc/mods is excluded), warns if not on the main
# branch, and scans hand-edited docs for stale semver literals that don't
# match the current version. Version discovery reads ycc/settings/packages.json
# directly: included native manifests are required to exist with a version
# (regardless of listed), deferred/excluded paths are suppressed, file-copy
# entries are skipped, and included opencode npm manifests are required to exist
# at the lockstep version (check-only). A bounded scan backstops unmodeled
# manifests. A missing or malformed model fails the check.
#
# Usage:
#   preflight.sh
#   preflight.sh -h|--help
#
# Exits 0 on success and prints: current_version=<ver>, branch=<name>
# Exits 1 on hard failure (tree dirty, version parity violation, or stale
# version literal detected in hand-edited docs)

Gate checks before a ycc release:
  1. git working tree is clean
  2. version parity across ycc/.claude-plugin/plugin.json, every
     marketplace plugins[] entry, and package manifests (ycc/mods excluded),
     driven by ycc/settings/packages.json (included native and opencode npm
     manifests required at the lockstep version; deferred/excluded suppressed)
     plus a bounded scan for unmodeled manifests
  3. warn if not on main branch
  4. no stale version literals (version: X.Y.Z or "version": "X.Y.Z")
     in hand-edited docs where the semver does not match the current
     version. Example literals should use the "<managed by the
     bundle-release skill>" placeholder — or match the current version.

Exits 0 on success and prints: current_version=<ver>, branch=<name>
Exits 1 on hard failure (tree dirty, version parity, or stale literal)
