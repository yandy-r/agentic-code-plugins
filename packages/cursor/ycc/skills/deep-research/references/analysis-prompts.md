## Phase 2 Agents: The Crucible

### Agent 1: ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses) Analyst

**Subagent Type**: `general-purpose`

**Task Description**: Conduct Analysis of Competing Hypotheses

**Prompt Template**:

````
Conduct an Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) on "{{RESEARCH_SUBJECT}}" using all persona findings.

## Research Context

You have access to findings from 8 research personas:

1. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/objective.md
2. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/historian.md
3. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/contrarian.md
4. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/analogist.md
5. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/systems-thinker.md
6. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/journalist.md
7. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/archaeologist.md
8. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/futurist.md
9. Read: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/persona-findings/negative-space.md

## Your Task: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses

ACH is a systematic method to evaluate multiple explanations and identify the most likely ones based on evidence.

### Step 1: Generate Hypotheses

Create 5+ mutually exclusive hypotheses about the research subject based on the persona findings. Hypotheses should:

- Cover the range of interpretations possible
- Be mutually exclusive (if one is true, others are false)
- Be specific enough to test against evidence
- Include conventional and contrarian views

### Step 2: Identify Evidence

Extract key pieces of evidence from all persona findings that could support or refute each hypothesis.

### Step 3: Evaluate Evidence vs Hypotheses

For each piece of evidence, assess:

- Which hypotheses it supports (consistent with)
- Which hypotheses it refutes (inconsistent with)
- Which hypotheses it doesn't affect (neutral)

Focus on **disconfirming evidence** - evidence that contradicts a hypothesis is more valuable than evidence that confirms it.

### Step 4: Assess Hypothesis Viability

After evaluating all evidence:

- Which hypotheses survive (have least disconfirming evidence)?
- Which hypotheses are eliminated (too much contradiction)?
- What's the relative strength of surviving hypotheses?

### Step 5: Identify Gaps

What evidence would help distinguish between remaining hypotheses?

## Output Format

Write your analysis to: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/synthesis/crucible-analysis.md

Structure your report as:

```markdown

2. **[Type of evidence]**: [What it would show and which hypothesis it would support]
3. **[Type of evidence]**: [What it would show and which hypothesis it would support]

## Assumptions Challenged
